Development of a high dimensional imaging mass cytometry panel to investigate spatial organization of tissue microenvironment in formalin-fixed archival clinical tissues

Several studies have demonstrated the existence of different phenotypes of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Various phenotypes might be distinguished using different markers. In this study we designed a IMC panel to investigate CAFs heterogeneity and their spatial organisation in archival tissues.

We provide a bioinformatics pipeline that allows users to:

- extract single-cell data information from Imaging Mass Cytometry images
- cluster phenotypical similar cells
- perform basic exploratory data analysis
- generate heatmaps and t-SNE plots
- visualise the spatial localization of cells in tissue
